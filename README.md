Data Preprocessing Scripts

This repository contains scripts I created for automating image data preprocessing. The key functionalities include:

    Labeling Automation: Utilizing the SAM (Segment Anything Model) to automate the labeling process for images.
    Data Augmentation: Implementing data augmentation techniques using the TensorFlow framework.
    Data Splitting: Splitting datasets using the Scikit-learn library.

Feel free to explore the scripts and adapt them for your own projects!
